# PWM
> **Note**
> Make sure you are connected to correct IP or serial number.

## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver with PWM

In order to use API correctly, please refer [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

If you want to build your own PWM application, try to use this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use this example

### Hardware Requirement

In order to run this example, you should get USBDAQF1RD product, which contains PWM function.

Then, we take `USBDAQF1RD` for example.

### USBDAQF1RD

If function return value is 0, it represents communication with `USBDAQF1RD` successfully.
