## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver with counter

In order to use API correctly, please refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

If you want to build your own counter application, try to use this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use this example

### Hardware Requirement

In order to run this example, you should get USBDAQF1DSNK product, which contains counter function.

Then, we take `USBDAQF1DSNK` for example.

### USBDAQF1DSNK

If function return value is 0, it represents communication with `USBDAQF1DSNK` successfully.
