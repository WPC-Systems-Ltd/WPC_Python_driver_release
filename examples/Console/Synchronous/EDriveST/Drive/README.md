## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to control motor driver

In order to use API correctly, please refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

If you'd like to create your own application, start by using this simple template, and then include your own code.

## How to use this example

### Hardware Requirement

In order to run this example, you should get EDriveST product, which contains motor driver function.

Then, we take `EDriveST` for example.

### EDriveST

If function return value is 0, it represents communication with `EDriveST` successfully.

## Troubleshooting
