# AHRS
> **Note**
> Ensure you are connected to the correct IP address or serial number.

## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC Python driver to acquire AHRS data.

For detailed API usage, refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

To create your own application, start with this simple template and then include your custom code.

## How To Use This Example

### Hardware Requirements

To run this example, you will need a WifiDAQE3AH product, which contains AHRS function.

Here we use WifiDAQE3AH as an example.

2. Connect to device
3. Open AHRS port
4. Start AHRS
5. Get AHRS data
6. Stop AHRS
7. Close AHRS port
8. Disconnect device
9. Release device handle
