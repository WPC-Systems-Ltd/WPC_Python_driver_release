## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to control motion

For detailed API usage, refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

To create your own application, start with this simple template and then include your custom code.

## How To Use This Example

### Hardware Requirements

To run this example, you will need a EMotion product, which contains motion function.

Then, we take `EMotion` for example.
