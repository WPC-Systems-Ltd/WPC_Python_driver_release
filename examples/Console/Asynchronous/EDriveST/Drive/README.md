## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to control motor driver

For detailed API usage, refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

To create your own application, start with this simple template and then include your custom code.

## How To Use This Example

### Hardware Requirements

To run this example, you will need a EDriveST product, which contains motor driver function.

Then, we take `EDriveST` for example.

### EDriveST

A return value of 0 indicates successful communication with the EDriveST.
