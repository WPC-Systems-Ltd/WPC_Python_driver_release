# DPOT
> **Note**
> Ensure you are connected to the correct IP address or serial number.

## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to read/write digital potentiometer resistance.

For detailed API usage, refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

To create your own application, start with this simple template and then include your custom code.

## How To Use This Example

### Hardware Requirements

To run this example, you will need a EthanP product, which contains DPOT function.

Then, we take `EthanP` for example.

## DPOT Interfacing SOP

1. Create device handle
2. Connect to device
3. Open DPOT
4. Read/Write digital potentiometer resistance
5. Close DPOT
6. Disconnect device
7. Release device handle
