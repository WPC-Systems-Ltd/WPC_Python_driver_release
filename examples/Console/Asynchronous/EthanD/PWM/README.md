# PWM
> **Note**
> Ensure you are connected to the correct IP address or serial number.

## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to communication with PWM

For detailed API usage, refer to the [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

To create your own application, start with this simple template and then include your custom code.

## How To Use This Example

### Hardware Requirements

To run this example, you will need a EthanD product, which contains PWM function.

Then, we take `EthanD` for example.

### EthanD

A return value of 0 indicates successful communication with the EthanD.
