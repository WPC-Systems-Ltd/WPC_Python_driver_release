## Overview

This project example code demonstrate how to use WPC python driver to get basic information from WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A and pinmode from WPC-USB-DAQ-F1-D.

In order to use API correctly, please refer [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

If you want to build your own application, try to use this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use this example

### Hardware Requirement

In order to run this example, you should have WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A or WPC-USB-DAQ-F1-D.
Then, we take `WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A` for example for example_get_device_info.py & example_get_Wifi_DAQ_status.
we take `WPC-USB-DAQ-F1-D` for example for eexample_get_pin_mode.py.
