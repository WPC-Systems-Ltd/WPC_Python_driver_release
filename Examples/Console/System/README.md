## Overview

This example project demonstrates how to use WPC python driver to get basic information 
such as firmware version, IP, RSSI and so on from WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A.

Additionally, try to execute `example_find_all_devices` to find all available WPC devices.

In order to use API correctly, please refer [documentation](https://wpc-systems-ltd.github.io/WPC_Python_driver_release/).

If you want to build your own application, try to use this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use this example

### Hardware Requirement

In order to run this example, you should get WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A or WPC-USB-DAQ-F1-D.
Then, we take `WPC-Wifi-DAQ-E3-A` for example_get_device_info.py & example_get_Wifi_DAQ_status to get basic device information.
We take `WPC-USB-DAQ-F1-D` for example_get_pin_mode.py. to get pin mode information.
